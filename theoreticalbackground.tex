\chapter{A Brief Introduction to Stereoscopy}

The theoretical section serves to present a thorough literature review and build the 
theoretical framework for the entire study. Thorough concept definition is essential for 
the  reader  to  understand  what  the  author  intends.  It  is  important  that  the  theoretical 
section forms a coherent whole with the entire thesis. Secondary issues concerning the 
actual thesis are not presented in the theoretical section. The reader can be assumed to 
be  a  technology  professional  without  any  specialized  knowledge  of  the  topic  in 
question. Hence, it is not necessary to present basic issues in the Masters thesis. 
In  addition  to  the  theory,  the  background  information  in  many  cases  includes,  for 
instance, a company's old products, the system to be replaced, standards to be followed 
and a company's internal practices, and other parts of the project if the thesis is part of a 
larger  project.  These  are  presented  in  as  great  detail  as  is  necessary  to  expound  the 
solutions and provide a general view.  
More detailed outlining and headlining of the chapter (including the main heading) 
is  to  be  planned  and  written  according  to  the  requirements  set  by  the  thesis.  The 
Theoretical  background  or  Starting  points  chapter  can  also  be  divided  into  several 
sub chapters.

We humans are gifted with a pair of eyes, which simultaneously captures rays of light and sends the 
information to our brain. The brain after some complex processing fuses them to create a three dimensional
(3D) map of the visible space. This 3D map is unique; it contains the approximate relative distance
of all the points in the scene with respect to the eye.

\paragraph{}
Thus, the photograph captured by a film or digital camera has one fundamental difference with the ones formed 
in the brain. The former is represented two dimensions (2D) i.e. height and width. It lacks the depth information, which in the field of computer vision (CV) is regarded as the third dimension.

\paragraph{}
Since, 3D viewing requires at least two light sensors, it is also regarded as stereoscopy. However, study
\cite{bib:stereo_cue} suggests, along with stereo vision the brain might use other cues to determine the relative distances and depth in a scene. These cues are gathered by only one eye and hence known as monocular (or extrastereoscopic) cues. They play a significant role in perception of depth. To an extent, the significance  depends on the distance between the observer and the scene. Some of the important ones are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Accommodation of the eye: Human eye can change its optical power in order to focus on the object of interest. This is achieved by changing the form of the elastic lens. Even though this is mostly a reflex action but can be controlled to some extent manually.
  
  \item Relative size: Objects which creates a bigger image on the retina is perceived to be closer.
  
  \item Relative height: Objects placed higher in the scene generally tend to be perceived as further away.
  
	\item Overlapping of objects: If one object is occluded by another, it is obvious that the occluding object is closer. This is also known as interposition.
		
	\item Linear perspective: The image of two parallel lines or edges, formed on the retina, seem to converge in such a way that they will eventually meet at infinity.
	
	\item Blur and desaturation: When the eyes focus on an object it forms a sharp and a color rich image on the retina. The part of the scene that lies outside the focus plane appears to be blur. Desaturation i.e. converting to gray-scale, a part of a scene also gives the effect of out-of-focus region.
	
	\item Haze, De-saturation, and a shift to bluishness: In the real world the light traveling from distant objects has to pass through dust or water vapor present in the air giving rise to such effects.
	
	\item Other cues: Light, cast shadow and textured pattern are some of the cues commonly used to replicate 3D scene.

\section{Stereoscopic 3D}
\paragraph{}
In this thesis, we will deal with stereoscopic images which are actually had the third dimension i.e. depth or disparity map. Such images are captured with two cameras which are synchronized and separated by a certain distance. Thus we obtain two images, left-view and right-view. 

\paragraph{}
A disparity map is computed from these two images. Each point may be considered as a two dimensional vector, which maps the corresponding points in the left and right view of a stereo pair. This is more commonly known as stereo matching or stereo correspondence and is discussed by D. Scharstein and R. Szeliski in \cite{bib:stereo_correspondence}.

\paragraph{}
Using the method of triangulation, a depth map is computed which indicates the relative distance of a point in the scene from the camera plane. Considering the disparity as $\emph{\textit{d}}$, base offset i.e. separation between the two cameras as $\emph{\textit{b}}$ and focal length to be $\emph{\textit{f}}$, the depth $\emph{D}$ can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
D = \frac{\textit{b} \cdot \textit{f}}{\textit{d}}
\end{equation}

The intensity values of depth-map in the \textit{figure~\ref{fig:depth_disparity}} is directly proportional to the distance of the region from the camera. Where as, the disparity

\subsection{Spatial-Depth super resolution for Range Images}
As discussed in \cite{Spatial_Depth_Super_Resolution}, using one or two registered color images as reference, we can iteratively refine the low-resolution depth map, in terms of both its spatial resolution and depth precision. This whole process is illustrated in the \textit{figure~\ref{fig:chapter2_op}}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Spatial_Depth_Super_Resolution_for_Range_Images.pdf}}
\caption[Framework for spatial-depth super resolution for range images]%
{\textit{Framework for spatial-depth super resolution for range images. The range image serves as the initial depth-map hypothesis. Then follows an iterative refinement process. A cost volume is built according to the current depth map hypothesis. A bilateral filter is then applied to the cost volume to avoid the smoothening effect near the depth discontinuities. A winner-takes-all and sub-pixel estimation procedure is used to produce a new depth map hypothesis, which is fed back into the process as described in \cite{Spatial_Depth_Super_Resolution}.}\label{fig:chapter2_op}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
The iterative refinement process has three major steps. First, a cost volume $C_{i}$ is generated from the current depth-map $D_{(i)}$. Second, a Bilateral Filtering is performed for each slice of the cost volume to generate a new cost volume $C_{(i)}^{CW}$. Finally the depth hypothesis with minimal cost is selected and a sup-pixel estimation is applied to obtain the final depth-map $D_{(i+1)}$.

\paragraph{}
Bilateral Filter forms one of the integral part in the iterative refinement process. It has been previously used with great success for stereo algorithms in \cite{Stereo_Matching} and \cite{Adaptive_Support_Weight_Approach}. In the next chapter we will elaborately discuss on this filtering scheme and also show how it's performance can be enhanced using a GPU device.
