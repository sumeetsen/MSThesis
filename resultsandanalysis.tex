\chapter{RESULTS AND ANALYSIS}

The purpose of the Results and Discussion chapter is to present the results of the study 
and  their  significance  to  the  reader.  It  may  be  useful  to  divide  the  Results  and 
Discussion chapter into several subchapters and provide them with titles which describe 
the contents in detail.  
The most important results, their error sources, deviations from the assumed results 
and reliability of the results are presented in the Results section. The results are to be presented  briefly  and  with  precision.  Images  and  tables  can  be  used  to  aid  the 
understanding of the results. The central message of the images and tables must also be 
presented  in  the  text.  If  necessary,  supplementary  information  can  be  presented  in 
appendices.  The  results  must  be  understandable  without  having  to  read  the  other 
sections of the thesis in detail. 
In  the  Discussion  section,  the  results  are  to  be  compared  to  the  previous  study 
presented  in  the  theoretical  section.  It  is  also  to  be  assessed  whether  the  results 
correspond  with  the  set  objectives,  as  well  as  does  the  thesis  answer  the  set  research 
questions. New information or otherwise significant information is to be emphasised in 
the discussion. In addition, the scientific and practical significance of the results is to be 
assessed.
