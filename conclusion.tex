\chapter{CONCLUSION}

\section{Conclusion}
The Conclusion is one of the most important chapters in the thesis. Many readers often 
read  only  the  introduction  and  conclusion.  Do  not  rely  on  the  results  to  speak  for 
themselves; the authors task is to show the contribution of the thesis to the reader with 
thorough explanations. Individual results are not repeated here, instead the main results 
are collected and their meaning is reflected.  
On   the   basis   of   the   study,   the   author   presents   concrete   procedures   and 
recommendations concerning the application of the results for different usage purposes 
and assesses the limitations regarding their use. The recommendations can be focused 
directly on the client or the field and society in general. The author should also assess 
the need for further research or development and the success of the work.
